- attachment plugin to extract text, detect language and content_type
- but do not store the extracted text
- copy the text to the multi-field
- the multi-field then distributes the text to its language-specific fields and lets each analyzer perform
- search must then be like "match fulltext.en or match fulltext.de or match fulltext.raw"
