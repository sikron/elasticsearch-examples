- use different analyzers, which also support stemming, maybe synonyms, stopwords, etc.
- fuzzy search
- did-you-mean search
- a mapping, where 1 content is analyzed into different languages (with sub-fields)
- update-by-query (plugin needed!)
- better use Entries.dynamicContent() to see what can be found and why. use it in test-constructor to immediatly see the content
